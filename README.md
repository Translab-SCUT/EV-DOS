1.Instructions for useï¼šAfter downloading, put DayTrips and EVDOS and other files in the same directory and just run EVDOS. Users can define parameters and select charger types, etc. in EVDOS and ModelPara.
2.Model Description: This model simulates the actual driving process of an electric vehicle through real driving data to explore the impact of different usage factors (charger type, regenerative braking system (RBS), heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and battery thermal management system (BTMS)) on battery life and energy consumption.
